# Code Challenge

You are tasked with creating a simple Ruby application that simulates a basic API for managing a collection of books. The API should allow you to perform the following operations:

1. Create a new book with a title, author, and publication year.
2. Retrieve a list of all books.
3. Retrieve a specific book by its ID.
4. Update a book's information (title, author, publication year).
5. Delete a book by its ID.

## Requirements

- Implement the API using Ruby (sinatra or rails).
- Use an in-memory data structure (like an array or hash) to store the book records.
- Ensure that the API handles errors gracefully (e.g., trying to retrieve or delete a book that does not exist).
- Write unit tests for your API endpoints.

## Constraints

- The challenge should be completed in less than 30 minutes.
- You may use any Ruby version that you are comfortable with.
- Clone and commit directly to main (DO NOT FORK).
- AI tools are NOT allowed (copilot, chatgpt, etc).
